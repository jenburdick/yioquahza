I have a pretty large home network with 20+ wired devices all running through one switch. I also have ~10 wireless devices which also feed back to the switch and then out to the world. I have one computer (macOS Sierra) that will kill my internet connection the shortly after being put on the network. Within a few seconds of removing it, my internet connection returns. This happens whether the computer is on wifi or wired. When the computer is on the network, all attempts to ping 8.8.8.8.

I tried using handbrake and the video on the m4v was all distorted, but the audio worked fine. Does anybody know how to fix this or know a better ripping service? Thanks for the help. Im using 10.10.5 i dunno if thats important. I don't know about other servers, but all day Origin has had extreme fluctuation. It sounds odd, but it seems that playing Tagpro brings down my wifi, intermittently. I never have any trouble with my wifi connection at other times, but while I'm playing Tagpro it will quite regularly drop out. 'ping', in a terminal, suddenly starts reporting "Request Timeout", and web pages won't load. This lasts for a while, then fixes itself. Any clues? Tagpro under Safari on a mac book pro, Mavericks. I've tried Chrome, but I get half the FPS, even with the "disable Sw accelerato. 
HAI lucky if you are reading this, can you please fix Centra it has been like really laggy for the past few days, I was streaing and thought that was the problem but even without it, it is still super laggy pls halp when you get a chance. Thanks!. With net neutrality sweeping the nation I was curious if there was a tool out there (besides simply pinging) that would show me if a website is getting a faster / slower response time during use. I have a 28 Mbps connection but can't seem to stream video from any netflix or hulu without buffering every 10 seconds. I have a 6 month old home built computer with 32 gigs of ram, a quad core and an NVidia 660 video card. I can play games without any issues and stream music just fine. I am hoping. I've been having some lag problems lately and I would like to run an MTR, get a diagnosis from one of the many experts here, and hopefully fix the problem. I tried to get a youtube tutorial but there is absolutely nothing. Can someone help me? EDIT : Could someone interpret this for me? I don't think it warrants a separate post http://i.imgur.com/iXX7BD7.png. Performance has been just terrible lately all the way around with PIA on Linux, Mac and Windows for some of us. No one can ever seem to determine for sure where the bottlenecks are happening at support or on here. amp#x200B; Can you please implement better diagnostics within the client or set up a diagnostic web app to determine WHERE bottlenecks are happening? Not knowing the cause and not being able to determine them even with \ MTR tools is a real problem. Thinking of joining Robinhood?

I tried different domains even domains from other countries and I only see the last hop. The only time I see all the hops is if I do mtr with -T (tcp) or -u (udp), but then most of the hops are all question marks. mtr with icmp used to work before. My gateway/firewall is centos7, I disabled firewall to see if that helped but it is still the same thing. If I do mtr from vms or my laptop Not in IT (yet) but learning. Just acquired an R610 on which to add more vms. Only problem is that it is dropping packets like they're out of style. The new machine is pve3 and is connected to 4 networks (one per port) for management, storage, trunk, and corosync. (Just like pve1 and pve 2.) eno1 and eno2 work fine and on the connected networks can ping pve1 and pve2 with no problems. However, eno3 and eno4 have a ~%80 or %100 drop rate. pve1 and pve 3 can ping each other (with high packet. ## Important Links - Official /r/Robinhood Discord Server: https://discord.gg/Robinhood (https://discord.gg/Robinhood) (It's where we are most of the time) - Callouts voice channel (https://discord.gg/b2kCWaF) - /u/myracksarelettuce's DD Depository (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4kp8ZmNPDxagU1LGob0EnUjQsz5dGlH4Bn54yaJ3l0) - mfun98's DD Request Thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/6cnetu/new_dd_request_thread/) - Guide for new investors (https://www.reddit.com/r/robinh.

It starts at 30-50, becoming noticeable but playable (50-80) after six or seven minutes, and then crippling (100-150) after ten minutes. If a game lasts the full 12 minutes, I'm basically crawling before the finish line. Then it resets to low ping again when the next game starts.
